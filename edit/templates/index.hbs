           <p>Coaching is a process that supports your growth and development on both personal and professional levels. it is not advice, mentoring, therapy, or counseling. Coaching is not a way for me to solve your problems. Rather, it is a relationship of exploration, reflection, challenge, and action.</p>

      How it works

        <div id="coachingTwo" class="collapse">
        <p>I will be an accountability partner to you. Most of the work of transformation will occur in between the times you and I speak. In ways that we co-design, I will hold you accountable to your own commitments. </p>
<p>Coaching can be especially useful for people who are going through important changes or who want to make major changes happen in their lives.</p>
<p>With me as your coach, you set the agenda. Together we look in you for the land of possibility. Together we chart the way from where you are now to where you yearn to be. </p>
<p>You will gain resourcefulness and power, finding within your own ingenuity the solutions to your problems. You will create new patterns and habits that serve you in alignment with your values and direction in life.</p>

     Nuts and bolts
        <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i>
      </a>
        <div id="coachingThree" class="collapse">
        <p>In individual coaching, dialogue between us will be our primary interaction, complemented by text and/or email correspondence between sessions, to the extent it is helpful. I typically have 45 minute sessions with individual clients by telephone, every two weeks. </p>
<p>In team coaching, the process is very similar. Together the group sets the agenda. Accompanying the group, we all look together within the group for what is most needed. Like an individual person, organizations have within themselves values, hopes, dreams, self-sabotaging patterns, traumas, untapped potential, forgotten resources, and the ever-present possibility of transformation. </p>
<p>Some typical elements of coaching sessions include values clarification, brainstorming, identifying plans of action, and examining modes of operating in life. I will sometimes ask you powerful questions and other times hold spacious silence as you work something out. </p>
<p>We all have many voices. Some sabotage and undermine. Others offer helpful resources and perspective. Noticing these voices and allowing their energy out is another way to increase consciousness and personal mastery.</p>

     My Clients

        <div id="coachingFour" class="collapse">
       <p>My clients inspire me! I coach clients who have had it with the same old gripes. I coach clients who are yearning to step into their power and claim the life of their dreams. I coach clients who have high ambitions to make great contributions and flourish personally while doing so.</p>
<p>I am especially eager to coach people who are taking new initiatives in their lives or work and thus need to grow rapidly to deal with increased complexity and challenge. Entrepreneurs, teams and founders of start-ups, and executives rising to new heights in their careers often fit this profile. People who have recently moved to a new part of the world or who are preparing for such a move also often find themselves a good fit for me as their coach.</p>

    <h2>About Dominic Longo</h2>
   <p> I am an executive coach, facilitator of transformation, and leadership development expert based in New York City. I have special expertise in cross-cultural communication and in helping leaders find meaning and purpose in their work. I am passionate about catalyzing the transformation of individuals and organizations to unlock their full potential for flourishing.</p>
<p>As a strategy consultant and Engagement Manager at McKinsey in both the Middle East and the United States, I focused on organizational transformations where developing new kinds of leadership and higher levels of capability were mission-critical. I also led internal training programs at McKinsey, including the week-long training program for new-hires and workshops on Centered Leadership and organizational change. </p>
<p>I have served clients across many industries and sectors in the Middle East and United States, particularly in tech, financial services, agriculture, education, medical devices, non-profits, and national governments. Earlier in my career, I was Middle East business development manager for the world’s largest agricultural irrigation manufacturer.</p>
<p>A published author and scholar of queer comparative theology, I am former director of the Muslim-Christian Dialogue Center at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, where I taught courses on leadership and diversity &amp; inclusion in undergraduate and MBA programs. I have delivered guest lectures at the University of Washington, KU Leuven (Belgium), Boston College, The Evergreen State College (Washington), Hamline University (Minnesota), &amp; The New School (NYC). I completed master’s and doctoral degrees in Arabic and Islamic Studies at Harvard University, as well as an undergraduate degree in French and German and a master’s degree in theology at Boston College. I am also an alum of the American University in Cairo, where I completed an intensive advanced Arabic program.</p>
<p>I am a member of the International Coach Federation, having completed the coaching curriculum at the Coaches Training Institute. My recent pro bono work focuses on coaching and mentoring recently released prisoners to help them adapt and flourish in society.</p>
<p>A citizen of the United States and Italy, I grew up in Nebraska and am a native English speaker with professional proficiency in Arabic, French, and German, and limited working proficiency in Italian and Spanish. Outside of the USA, I have lived, worked, or studied in Egypt, Dubai, Bahrain, Germany, France, Turkey, Italy, El Salvador, and Costa Rica. </p>
<p>I especially enjoy scintillating conversation over shared meals, eye-opening experiences of world cultures and art, plus engaging my body in building greater strength, flexibility, and new skills. For many years I have sung in choirs of various kinds, most recently in a gay men’s chorus.</p>
