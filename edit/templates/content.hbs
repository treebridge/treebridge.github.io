<h2>Coaching</h2>
<p>Coaching is a process that supports your growth and development on both personal and professional levels. it is not advice, mentoring, therapy, or counseling. Coaching is not a way for me to solve your problems. Rather, it is a relationship of exploration, reflection, challenge, and action. </p>
<h2>How coaching works</h2>
<p>I will be an accountability partner to you. Most of the work of transformation will occur in between the times you and I speak. In ways that we co-design, I will hold you accountable to your own commitments. </p>
<p>Coaching can be especially useful for people who are going through important changes or who want to make major changes happen in their lives.</p>
<p>With me as your coach, you set the agenda. Together we look in you for the land of possibility. Together we chart the way from where you are now to where you yearn to be. </p>
<p>You will gain resourcefulness and power, finding within your own ingenuity the solutions to your problems. You will create new patterns and habits that serve you in alignment with your values and direction in life.</p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>In individual coaching, dialogue between us will be our primary interaction, complemented by text and/or email correspondence between sessions, to the extent it is helpful. I typically have 45 minute sessions with individual clients by telephone, every two weeks. </p>
<p>In team coaching, the process is very similar. Together the group sets the agenda. Accompanying the group, we all look together within the group for what is most needed. Like an individual person, organizations have within themselves values, hopes, dreams, self-sabotaging patterns, traumas, untapped potential, forgotten resources, and the ever-present possibility of transformation. </p>
<p>Some typical elements of coaching sessions include values clarification, brainstorming, identifying plans of action, and examining modes of operating in life. I will sometimes ask you powerful questions and other times hold spacious silence as you work something out. </p>
<p>We all have many voices. Some sabotage and undermine. Others offer helpful resources and perspective. Noticing these voices and allowing their energy out is another way to increase consciousness and personal mastery.</p>
<h2>Who I coach</h2>
<p>My clients inspire me! I coach clients who have had it with the same old gripes. I coach clients who are yearning to step into their power and claim the life of their dreams. I coach clients who have high ambitions to make great contributions and flourish personally while doing so.</p>
<p>I am especially eager to coach people who are taking new initiatives in their lives or work and thus need to grow rapidly to deal with increased complexity and challenge. Entrepreneurs, teams and founders of start-ups, and executives rising to new heights in their careers often fit this profile. People who have recently moved to a new part of the world or who are preparing for such a move also often find themselves a good fit for me as their coach.</p>
<h2>Explore the possibilities</h2>
<p>Get in touch to schedule an exploratory session in which we get to know each other and explore our potential fit for a coaching relationship. I will come into this conversation extremely curious about you and your wildest dreams! </p>   <h2>Leadership Development</h2>
<p>Leadership development spurs and accelerates growth through a program that includes coaching and a suite of complementary interventions. Examples of program elements include workshops, retreats, experiences in nature, interactions with art, journaling, and experiments. Team and/or individual coaching undergirds and accompanies all elements.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Most often teams embark on a leadership development journey together. Team members challenge and support one another in this process. The challenges and delights of team dynamics fuel the learning. </p>
<p>Since such journeys unfold over time, I typically will accompany clients over the course of some months. Intensive experiences will be interspersed over the duration of your journey of change. In between, you will put into practice what you are learning and experiment with new possibilities. </p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>In the design phase, we will gain clarity about what is currently happening. We will align on audacious goals that best express your purpose and ambition. The elements of your journey will then be custom designed to achieve your goals. One leader from your organization will be the champion for this journey, and typically another will be the liaison for logistics. </p>
<p>Following the design phase, the real journey begins. Depending on the scale of the program, I will bring additional coaches and transformation facilitators to collaborate on certain interventions. We will communicate regularly about how the journey is going and whether any course adjustments are required. </p>
<h2>My clients</h2>
<p>I have designed and delivered many leadership development programs in organizations across industries, in the USA and the Middle East. I have seen tremendous transformation of individuals and teams over the course of these journeys, with dramatic improvements in their personal and organizational performance. </p>
<p>Although leadership development programs are most often for groups, it is also conceivable for us to craft a bespoke leadership development journey just for you. I am open to co-creating with you a personal development program that brings you into a realization of your wildest dreams. If you are willing and able to make a earth-shattering life-changing commitment to yourself, let’s talk!</p>
<h2>Explore the possibilities</h2>
<p>Get in touch to schedule a time for us discuss your organization and the kind of challenges you are facing. I will be especially curious as to why now feels like potentially the right time to begin a leadership development journey for yourself and your team. We will touch on the potential scope of this program, including number of participants, timeframe, and location.</p>
