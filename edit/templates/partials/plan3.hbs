       <p>I show up as a leader in the world through speaking and writing. These modes of expression are how I craft ideas, arrive at new insights, sculpt possible models for being and living, and inquire into what it all means ultimately. Our dialogue moves all of us forward.</p>

    <div id="speakingFour" class="collapse">
     <p>My speeches and workshop facilitation draw upon my reflection and writing as well as my action and experience in the world. I am ready to craft a customized talk or workshop for a special event or occasion, or for a group that is in need of stimulation and growth. I am eager to share with your audience the fruits of my work as a scholar, a leader, and a contemplative in action.</p>

     <p>Sample topics of speeches and academic talks include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Islamic Spiritual Resources for Leaders Today</li>
      <li>What Leaders Can Learn from Muslim-Christian Dialogue</li>
      <li>Beyond Theological Hate-Speech in Christian-Muslim Relations</li>
      <li>Queer Comparative Theology </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Workshops make learning real, through lived experience. I have designed and facilitated a wide range of leadership development workshops, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Becoming an Inspiring Leader through Finding Meaning</li>
      <li>Managing your Energy, Finding your Power</li>
      <li>Taste, Smell, and Touch Islam: A cultural salon of the five senses</li>
      <li>My Land, Your Land, Our Land: Moving into One Another’s Stories </li>

      <h3>What I Believe</h3>
      <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div id="speakingTwo" class="collapse">
      <p>I believe that too much of the time most of us miss what is really happening. Too often we are half-consciously performing hackneyed caricatures received from sitcoms and advertisements. Dazed moments accumulate.</p>
      <p>If we step back to look at ourselves more consciously, we can notice the misalignment between our lives and our values. Pre-fabricated goals and absolutely uncreative forms of living determine our professional quests, our domestic projects, and our leisurely pursuits. Cookie cutters lop off the most quirky and delightful parts of ourselves.</p>
      <p>Exploring almost forgotten nooks and crannies of reality can help clear this desperate malaise. The grandeur of the universe spreads out immensely. We need only to notice it. The magnificence of ourselves rests deep within us. We need only attend to it. </p>

      <h3>What I Write</h3>
      <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i>
    </a>
    <div id="speakingThree" class="collapse">
      <p>As an explorer of ultimate reality, both within and without, I traverse the treasure stores of the human experience that are held in the texts of the Christian and Islamic traditions. I am no archaeologist. As fascinated as I am by the thoughts and discoveries of great souls and sharp minds from centuries past, my final focus is us here now. I traverse these forgotten stores to retrieve treasures of insight and possibility for us today.</p>
      <p>I am a theologian who constructs new meaning for us here now in conversation with sages of the past. My research is time travel. I am a comparative theologian who builds bridges of mutual understanding between Christians and Muslims and others who attend to Ultimate Reality. My writing begets solidarity and appreciation.</p>
      <p>I practice interreligious dialogue to make real and practical and present the vision I hold for mutual understanding and appreciation among members of different communities. I practice queer theology to re-think the body and the erotic, their meanings and their possibilities. </p>
