        <p>Most often teams embark on a leadership development journey together. Team members challenge and support one another in this process. The challenges and delights of team dynamics fuel the learning. </p>
      <p>Since such journeys unfold over time, I typically will accompany clients over the course of 3-12 months. Intensive experiences will be interspersed over the duration of your journey of change. In between, you will put into practice what you are learning and experiment with new possibilities. </p>

      <p>In the design phase, we will gain clarity about what is currently happening. We will align on audacious goals that best express your purpose and ambition. The elements of your journey will then be custom designed to achieve your goals. One leader from your organization will be the champion for this journey, and typically another will be the liaison for logistics. </p>
      <p>Following the design phase, the real journey begins. Depending on the scale of the program, I will bring additional coaches and transformation facilitators to collaborate on certain interventions. We will communicate regularly about how the journey is going and whether any course adjustments are required. </p>
