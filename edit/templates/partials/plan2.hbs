   <p>My clients have undergone tremendous transformation over the course of leadership development journeys that I have designed and delivered. At the individual and organizational level, they have seen dramatic improvements in their performance.
</p>
<p>I have designed and delivered many leadership development programs in organizations across industries and in the public sector, in the USA and the Middle East.
</p>
<p>Although leadership development programs are most often for groups, we could craft a bespoke leadership development journey just for you. I am open to co-creating with you a personal development program that brings you into a realization of your wildest dreams. If you are willing and able to make an earth-shattering, life-changing commitment to yourself, letâ€™s talk!

        <p>Team members challenge and support one another in this process. The challenges and delights of team dynamics fuel the learning.
</p>
<p>Since such journeys unfold over time, I typically will accompany clients over the course of 3-12 months. Intensive experiences will be interspersed over the duration of your journey of change. In between, you will put into practice what you are learning and experiment with new possibilities.

     <p>In the design phase, we will gain clarity about what is currently happening. We will align on audacious goals that best express your purpose and ambition. The elements of your journey will then be custom designed to achieve your goals. One leader from your organization will be the champion for this journey, and typically another will be the liaison for logistics.
</p>
<p>Following the design phase, the real journey begins. Depending on the scale of the program and number of participants, I will bring additional coaches and transformation facilitators to collaborate on certain interventions. We will communicate regularly about how the journey is going and whether any course adjustments are required.</p>
<p>I lead primarily in English, and can use French, Arabic, and German as secondary working languages.
